abstract = {We study a novel operational problem that considers vehicle positioning in on-demand rental networks, such as car sharing in the wider context of a competitive market in which users select vehicles based on access. Existing approaches consider networks in isolation; our competitor-aware model takes supply situations of competing networks into account. We combine online machine learning to predict market-level demand and supply with dynamic mixed integer nonlinear programming. For evaluation, we use discrete event simulation based on real-world data from Car2Go and DriveNow. Our model outperforms conventional models that consider the fleet in isolation by a factor of two in terms of profit improvements. In the case we study, the highest theoretical profit improvements of 7.5{\%} are achieved with a dynamic model. Operators of on-demand rental networks can use our model under existing market conditions to build a profitable competitive advantage by optimizing access for consumers without the need for fleet expansion. Model effectiveness increases further in realistic scenarios of fleet expansion and demand growth. Our model accommodates rising demand, defends against competitors' fleet expansion, and enhances the profitability of own fleet expansions.},

abstract = {The research focuses on the potential use of DGE (diethylene glycol diethyl ether), as a high-cetane number oxygenated additive to diesel-like fuels. Apart from evaluating its individual effects an investigation of how DGE can facilitate the use of bio-ethanol in diesel engines was conducted; which faces many technical difficulties, but can provide environmental advantages over biodiesel and conventional diesel fuel. Four partly renewable fuel blends with varying contents of DGE and ethanol were designed with overall diesel-replacement rate of 20{\%}. DGE was found to reduce gaseous emissions, achieving a simultaneous reduction in both soot and NOx which highlighted the beneficial effects of its high cetane number and oxygen content. In ethanol–diesel blends small additions of DGE significantly enhanced blend stability and blend auto-ignition properties. Improvements in the NOx/soot trade-off characteristics were obtained for all blends. All tested blends produced lower particulate matter number concentrations and soot with characteristics that reduced their oxidation temperatures, hence providing benefits for diesel particulate filter (DPF) regeneration. Overall it was found that DGE fuel provides considerable energy and environmental benefits if used both as a single oxygenate with diesel or in multicomponent blends with ethanol and diesel.},
