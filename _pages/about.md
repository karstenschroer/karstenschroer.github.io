I am a PhD Researcher in Operations Management (OM) and Information Systems (IS) at the [Institute for Information Systems at U. of Cologne](https://is3.uni-koeln.de/en/team/doctoral-researchers/karsten-schroer) and a Visting PhD Researcher at the [Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley](https://haas.berkeley.edu/scholars/current-visiting-scholars/).
<!-- I am also affiliated with the [Institute of  Energy Economics at the U. of Cologne](https://www.ewi.uni-koeln.de/en/team/karsten-schroer/).  -->
I hold a Master‚Äôs degree in Industrial Engineering from the University of Cambridge and a Bacherlor‚Äôs degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Birmingham. Prior to embarking on my academic career I gained extensive industry experience at leading management consultancies including [Roland Berger](https://www.rolandberger.com/en/) and [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com).

My research interests lie in the application of data-driven methods to (1) **understanding** and (2) **resolving** large-scale societal challenges. I especially focus on issues in the domains of sustainable energy and transport. I draw on `causal inference`, `(spatial) machine learning`, `mathematical programming` and `reinforcement learning` to achieve two general research objectives:

<!-- My research focuses broadly on data analytics and decision making in cyber-physical systems, with a special emphasis on the domains of digital energy and mobility.  -->

1. Infer and quantify **causal effects of new technologies and policies** on human behavior, society and the environment to derive actionable policy and managerial insights.
1. Develop **mathematical decision algorithms** for planning and operating digital energy and mobility systems against environmental, cost, service level, and other objectives.


My work has been presented at [leading OM and IS conferences]({{ site.url }}/publications/) and is published in [top-ranked journals]({{ site.url }}/publications/). Examples include the development of an integrated machine learning and mathematical programming framework for the [competitor-aware management of shared vehicle fleets](http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/trsc.2021.1097), the quantification of the [impact of e-scooters introduction on society and the environment](https://aisel.aisnet.org/sprouts_proceedings_siggreen_2019), or using simulation-optimization and reinforcement learning for planning and operating large-scale electric vehicle charging hubs, among other projects.

In my free time I am an avid rower üö£ , runner üèÉ and have recently taken up cycling üö≤ . I am also interested in all things data and am passionate about technology-driven solution approaches to global warming.
